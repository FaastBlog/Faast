## Getting Started

### Deployment

**Important:**  For security reasons, Github does not allow plugins (under `_plugins/`) when
deploying with Github Pages.

**1** deploy the static website with Jekyll-compatible hosters, such as https://www.netlify.com/, that allow for deployment from the Github repo and publish the website using CDNs. Netlify has a free starter offer.

For **1)** simply clone this repository (*master branch*), and then run
`bundle install`, then
`bundle exec jekyll serve`, then
your site is built to the `/site` folder beside your root folder.

### Author Pages

In order to properly generate author pages you need to rename the field *author* in the
front matter of every post to match that of your each author's *username* as defined
in the *[\_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml)* file.
With the latest update, multiple author blogs are now supported out of the box.

### Compiling Styles

Following on the way Casper styles are compiled as [described here](https://github.com/tryghost/casper#development):

Jasper2 styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.
