# Forget this 5 excuses and get motivated to run.


>The only things that stands in between you and the person you want to be are excuses. Do not take you to the point of thinking doing your workout is impossible!

### 'I am too tired!'

You only can gain new and more energy by spending your available one. And even while using energy for running, you gather more energy through pouring out endorphins in our brain. And by the way you get improved sleep quality, that gets you more power for the next day. So use the positive effect of running at regular intervals for better life quality.

### 'The weather is too bad!'

Clothes are amazing. So use them. Sports cloths are available at all price classes. Spend some money on quality products, so bad weather wont harm your workout plan.

### 'Running does not suit me!'

Human evolution has created our amazing running ability over the course of many millennia.
So if you have two working legs go out there, you are perfect for running.


### 'Running is boring..!'

You think running is boring? Try to have a goal in mind to keep motivated. Jogging to your post office or on nice spots like watchtowers or the nearest lake. Take runs home after work. Meet up with friends.

Listen to music, the right playlist keeps up pace and motivation.

Try new terrain. Exploring new places while running keeps yourself interested.

At worst, think you could be one of the few who could survive a zombie apocalypse.

### 'I have no time!'

If you have time to read this article, take a run! 
Twenty minutes are day are enough for a beneficial workout.
